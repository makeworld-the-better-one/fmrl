# fmrl

I find Discord status messages fun, and a nice way to make someone laugh, see how friends or doing, or find out about new games and music. But what if we freed them from Discord? What could they become?

Enter fmrl. Pronounced like the word ephemeral, it is a decentralized protocol to read user statuses and set your own. From "Chilling" to "Get me out of here" to "This is the best album ever", fmrl is there for you.

## Current Status

As of December 2021:

The protocol and project has only just begun. No software exists yet, and the protocol is receiving community feedback and may change rapidly.

## Branding

Please style the name as fmrl or if necessary, FMRL. Never Fmrl.

## Philosophy

- No feeds, just one message from people you follow
- No history, just the current message
- No paragraphs, just a statement

## Software

Coming soon! If you implement any software let me know. Please make it clear in your project README what version of the spec your software supports.

## Specification

Please see the [Specification](./spec.md).

## FAQ

**Q: Isn't this just like [finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_%28protocol%29)?**

A: The main difference is that the data is structured, while finger data is just a text file. Structured data allows for more flexiblity in displaying statuses.

**Q: Are you hoping to change the world?**

A: No. I'm hoping to create something fun, that some people would use and get a kick out of.

Maybe this is something that the [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) crowd will use, people who are already willing to try something new and understand the merits of decentralization. Some sort of integration like a Mastdon+fmrl client would be really cool.
